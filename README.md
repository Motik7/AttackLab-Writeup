# AttackLab-Writeup
Attack Lab Writeup for UCLA's CS33 Introduction to Computer Organization Course

## Introduction
The Attack Lab is a demonstration of potential binary exploitation using code injection and ROP attacks. The Attack Lab is separated into 4 phases. The first two are code injection attacks, and the last two are ROP attacks. As of now, I have completed only the first three phases. The last one will be done sometime later. The spec for this assignment is provided in attack_lab_spec.pdf

## Target801
Target801 contains the attack lab code along with solutions. Solutions are of the form `sol\[\[:digit:\]\]\*.txt`. For non-solution files see README.txt within the folder
