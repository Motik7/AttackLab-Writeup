# AttackLab-Writeup
Attack Lab Writeup for UCLA's CS33 Introduction to Computer Organization Course


The Attack Lab is a demonstration of potential binary exploitation using code injection and ROP attacks.
The Attack Lab is separated into 4 phases. The first two are code injection attacks, and the last two are
ROP attacks. As of now, I have completed only the first three phases. The last one will be done sometime later.
The spec for this assignment is provided in attack_lab_spec.pdf
